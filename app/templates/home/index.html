  <p class = "lead"> Some local non-profit organizations have their own well-designed websites, yet some don’t due to limitations on resources. If one wants to contribute to the local community, he/she might need to spend a lot of time searching for volunteering opportunities. Why don’t we simplified the communication process between organizations and individuals to avoid extra hours spent on searching or promoting? This is the inspiration to create this platform, <code><i>Helps</i></code>, to speedily and directly connects volunteers with local non-profit organizations. On  <code><i>Helps</i></code>, local non-profit organizations in Rochester can post their upcoming events, while volunteers can easily sign up and schedule their volunteering times based on their availabilities. </p>
